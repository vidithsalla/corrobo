# Failure matrix

What corrobo does at every failure point it knows about, and the test that proves it. The rules:

- Every row that claims corrobo behavior cites at least one automated test (`T…`, listed at the bottom with its exact file and title). `tests/failure-matrix-doc.test.ts` fails the build if a cited test is renamed or deleted, or if a row cites nothing.
- Rows whose outcome depends on your contract, not on corrobo, say **Assumes:** and name what you must get right. corrobo can't verify those for you.
- "Duplicate?" means: can this situation, handled by corrobo as described, cause the external effect to happen twice? It is about corrobo's own execution path; writes made outside corrobo are out of scope everywhere.

Vocabulary: evidence states `APPLIED` · `NOT_APPLIED` · `CONFLICTED` · `PENDING` · `UNKNOWN`; dispositions `COMPLETE` · `RETRY` · `REPLAN` · `REVIEW` · `INVESTIGATE`. `maxInFlightMs` is the contract's declared bound on how long a failed request could still land ([spec §O](v0.1-spec.md#o-fencing-and-settlement-when-the-lock-is-not-enough)).

## 1. Transport ambiguity

| # | Failure | What's actually true | corrobo records | `execute()` again? | Duplicate? | You do | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | None — normal success | Effect applied | `APPLIED` → `COMPLETE` | No | No | Nothing | T1 |
| 1.2 | Response lost **after** the provider committed (timeout, reset) | Effect applied | `APPLIED` → `COMPLETE` (read back, not assumed failed) | No | No | Nothing | T2, T3, T4 |
| 1.3 | Request lost **before** the provider saw it | Nothing applied | `NOT_APPLIED` → `RETRY` with `retryNotBefore`; after the window, re-observed, then one new attempt | Once, after the window | No | Call again after `retryNotBefore` | T5, T6, T11, T12 |
| 1.4 | Request lands **late**, after corrobo first looked | Applied, but later | First `NOT_APPLIED` → `RETRY` (deferred); the re-check before retrying finds `APPLIED` → `COMPLETE` | No | No | Call again after `retryNotBefore` | T7, T8 |
| 1.5 | Transport failure, contract declares no `maxInFlightMs` | Unknown whether it will land | `NOT_APPLIED` → `INVESTIGATE` (`IN_FLIGHT_NOT_RULED_OUT`) | No | No | Decide manually, or declare `maxInFlightMs` | T9, T10 |
| 1.6 | `execute()` returned a response, but the effect isn't there | Not applied, request finished | `NOT_APPLIED` → `RETRY` immediately (per retry policy) | Yes, once | No | Nothing | T13, T42 |
| 1.7 | Transport failure with provider-side idempotency | Either; the provider deduplicates | The contract sends one key on every attempt, so a retry while the first request is still in flight returns the original result instead of a second effect; its read-back only reads (it never re-sends the request); with `maxInFlightMs: 0` the retry decision is immediate | Possibly, deduplicated by the provider | No, within the provider's key retention | Keep the key stable per operation. **Assumes:** the provider really deduplicates on it | T14, T15, T92 |

## 2. Crash boundaries

| # | Failure | What's actually true | corrobo records | `execute()` again? | Duplicate? | You do | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Crash at any point after the attempt starts | Depends on when | The attempt is reserved before `execute()` runs, so a restart finds a reservation, never an empty record. What the restart then does is rows 2.2–2.6 | See 2.2–2.6 | No | Run again | T16, T17 |
| 2.2 | Crash after the effect, before the outcome is saved | Effect applied | Restart observes first: `APPLIED` → `COMPLETE`, resolved in place | No | No | Run again | T18 |
| 2.3 | Crash; restart observes nothing, no `maxInFlightMs` | Unknown whether it will land | `NOT_APPLIED` → `INVESTIGATE` | No | No | Decide manually | T19 |
| 2.4 | Crash; restart observes nothing, window already passed | Not applied | `NOT_APPLIED` → `RETRY`; the retry executes once | Once | No | Run again | T20 |
| 2.5 | Crash; restart observes nothing inside the window; dead request lands later | Applied, late | `RETRY` deferred; the re-check finds `APPLIED` → `COMPLETE` | No | No | Run again after `retryNotBefore` | T21 |
| 2.6 | Crash; restart can't observe | Unknown | `UNKNOWN` → `INVESTIGATE` | No | No | Investigate | T22 |
| 2.7 | `execute()` succeeds but returns data the store can't serialize (e.g. circular SDK object in Postgres) | Effect applied | That pass throws; the reservation survives; the next run observes: `APPLIED` → `COMPLETE` | No | No | Run again; return plain data from `execute()` | T23 |
| 2.8 | Process restart with `PostgresStore` | — | Operation, intent and evidence reload from Postgres | — | — | Nothing | T24, T34 |
| 2.9 | Process restart with `InMemoryStore` | — | Every record is gone; corrobo no longer knows the operation was attempted | Yes — it looks new | **Yes** | Use `PostgresStore` wherever a restart matters | T101 |
| 2.10 | Crash mid-attempt, then a deploy shortens `maxInFlightMs` before recovery | The crashed request can still land within the window it was sent under | The attempt records the window it was sent under; recovery never settles it with a shorter one, so the retry waits for the original window and the re-check then finds a late landing | Not before the original window | No | Run again | T177 |

## 3. Observation failures

| # | Failure | What's actually true | corrobo records | `execute()` again? | Duplicate? | You do | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | `observe()` throws or times out | Unknown | `observation_failed` → (contract) `UNKNOWN` → `INVESTIGATE`, never `NOT_APPLIED` | No | No | Investigate | T25, T26, T27 |
| 3.2 | Create succeeded but its read-back failed | Applied | `UNKNOWN` → `INVESTIGATE` (not assumed applied) | No | No | Investigate | T28 |
| 3.3 | The re-check before a deferred retry can't read the target | Unknown | `UNKNOWN` → `INVESTIGATE` | No | No | Investigate | T29 |
| 3.4 | Read is stale, from a replica, or a search that can't prove absence | Unknown | corrobo passes `authoritative` and `source` to `reconcile()` unchanged; the evidence state is whatever your `reconcile()` says. **Assumes:** a read that can't prove absence returns `UNKNOWN`, never `NOT_APPLIED` | Only if your contract says `NOT_APPLIED` | **Yes, if the contract is wrong** | Map weak reads to `UNKNOWN`; size `maxInFlightMs` to cover replication lag | T30, T31 |

## 4. Convergence (`PENDING`)

| # | Failure | What's actually true | corrobo records | `execute()` again? | Duplicate? | You do | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Provider accepted, effect not final yet | In progress | `PENDING`, no disposition; the next run re-observes | No | No | Call again later | T32, T33 |
| 4.2 | `PENDING` → `APPLIED` | Applied | `APPLIED` → `COMPLETE`, same attempt | No | No | Nothing | T33, T34 |
| 4.3 | `PENDING` → provider rejected it | Not applied, request finished | `NOT_APPLIED` → `RETRY` per policy (one new attempt), or `INVESTIGATE` if not retryable | Once, if policy allows | No | Nothing / investigate | T35, T36 |
| 4.4 | Concurrent callers while `PENDING` | In progress | One execution; convergence needs no second one | No | No | Nothing | T37 |
| 4.5 | Stays `PENDING` for a long time (many polls) | Not final yet | Re-observed on each call, never re-executed; the history keeps the first observation and the most recent ones (at most 20), so the record doesn't grow without limit | No | No | Call again later; escalate if it never settles | T182, T183 |

## 5. Conflict

| # | Failure | What's actually true | corrobo records | `execute()` again? | Duplicate? | You do | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | The world changed under the plan (stale version, already refunded) | Diverged from intent | `CONFLICTED` → `REPLAN`, closed | No | No | Make a new plan with a new identity | T38, T39, T40 |
| 5.2 | Records for this operation already existed before corrobo ran (written by something else) | More than intended | corrobo has no record of them, so it executes once, then observes `CONFLICTED` → `REPLAN`. It does not pre-check before the first attempt | Once (the first attempt) | Only what already existed | Investigate the outside writer | T41 |

## 6. Retries and disposition rules

| # | Failure | corrobo records | `execute()` again? | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | Settled `NOT_APPLIED`, retry allowed, attempts left | `RETRY`; the next run makes a genuinely new attempt | Once per call | T42 |
| 6.2 | Retry budget exhausted | `INVESTIGATE` | No | T43 |
| 6.3 | Operation type not declared retryable | `INVESTIGATE` | No | T44 |
| 6.4 | `UNKNOWN`, `PENDING`, `CONFLICTED`, `APPLIED` | Never `RETRY`, whatever the retry policy | No | T45, T102, T103, T104 |
| 6.5 | Called again after the operation closed | Recorded result returned | No | T46, T100 |
| 6.6 | Contract settings that would be unsafe or unfinishable (`maxInFlightMs` negative, NaN or infinite; `maxAttempts` not a positive integer; …) | `TypeError` before anything runs: no record, no `execute()` | No | T178, T179 |
| 6.7 | `authorize()` returns something malformed (`{}`, `requiresReview: 0`, …) | `TypeError` before the operation is recorded; never treated as "no review needed" | No | T185 |
| 6.8 | `reconcile()` throws, or returns something malformed, after `execute()` | `UNKNOWN` → `INVESTIGATE` (`RECONCILE_FAILED`), resolved and closed, instead of a `RESERVED` attempt every call throws on | No | T186 |
| 6.9 | After `execute()`, a hook returns something the store can't copy: reason metadata with a cycle or BigInt, or an `observe()` result with a cycle, BigInt, function or Proxy, or one that isn't an observation (`null`, an unknown status, `observation_failed` without an error), or one whose getters answer differently later | The metadata is replaced by a note; the observation counts as failed (`UNKNOWN`), and what's stored is a snapshot read once; either way the attempt resolves instead of every call failing at the same write | No | T188, T189, T191, T192 |

## 7. Review

| # | Failure | corrobo records | `execute()` again? | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | `authorize()` requires review | `REVIEW`, `AWAITING_REVIEW`; nothing executed | Not until approved | T47 |
| 7.2 | Approved | Executes exactly once | Once | T48 |
| 7.3 | Rejected | Closed with `POLICY_REVIEW_REJECTED` | Never | T49 |
| 7.4 | Called again after rejection | Stays closed | Never | T50 |
| 7.5 | `revalidate()` runs before an attempt | Before every attempt, including the first, and before the attempt is reserved, with this call's `context`; a `proceed` is recorded on the attempt | Only on `proceed` | T116, T124 |
| 7.6 | `revalidate()` says `reject` | `CLOSED`, `REPLAN` (new decision, new identity); the check is recorded on the operation; nothing reserved | Never | T117, T128 |
| 7.7 | `revalidate()` says `requiresReview` | `AWAITING_REVIEW`, `REVIEW`; after approval it runs again (with the acting call's `context` and the approval) before anything executes, and can send it back to review | Not until approved *and* revalidated | T118, T119 |
| 7.8 | `revalidate()` throws, or returns something that isn't a valid result (including one whose fields throw when read) | `REVALIDATION_FAILED`, operation stays `OPEN`, nothing reserved; a later call checks again | Not until a check passes | T120, T121, T133 |
| 7.9 | Things changed between attempt 1 and attempt 2 (scope revoked, order cancelled) | Attempt 2 is stopped; attempt 1's evidence is still reported | No | T122 |
| 7.10 | A late landing while `revalidate()` would now say no | The settlement re-check finds `APPLIED` → `COMPLETE`; `revalidate()` is never asked (it gates new effects, not finding out what happened) | No | T123 |
| 7.11 | Approved after earlier attempts (revalidation sent attempt 2 to review) | The latest attempt is re-observed before executing, whether its transport failed or got a response; an effect found then is `COMPLETE`. Rejected instead: `CLOSED` with `POLICY_REVIEW_REJECTED`, attempt 1's evidence kept | Only if approved and still a settled `NOT_APPLIED` | T125, T130, T131, T132 |
| 7.12 | Restart finds a reserved, unresolved attempt | Observes only; `revalidate()` isn't called because nothing executes | No | T126 |
| 7.13 | Another pass writes while `revalidate()` runs (lost lock) | The reservation is version-checked and fails; nothing executes | No | T127 |
| 7.14 | Approved with a `ReviewDecision` | Recorded on the operation with reviewer, times and the recorded intent's fingerprint, and copied onto the attempt it allowed; survives a restart | Once | T134, T140 |
| 7.15 | Rejected with a `ReviewDecision` | `CLOSED`, `POLICY_REVIEW_REJECTED` naming the reviewer; a later decision can't replace it | Never | T135, T141 |
| 7.16 | The reviewer was shown a different intent (`intentFingerprint` doesn't match) | Refused (throws); nothing recorded | Not on that approval | T136 |
| 7.17 | Malformed decision passed to `reviewEffect()` (no reviewer, `expiresAt` on a rejection, a time that isn't strict RFC 3339 with `Z` or an offset, a date that doesn't exist…) | `TypeError` before anything is recorded; valid times are stored in one canonical UTC form | No | T137, T148 |
| 7.18 | Approval already expired when it arrives | Refused (throws); nothing recorded | No | T138 |
| 7.19 | Approval expires before a later attempt, or while `revalidate()` is running | `AWAITING_REVIEW` with `APPROVAL_EXPIRED`; checked again after `revalidate()` returns, at the time the attempt would start; a new approval allows the attempt | Not until re-approved | T139, T144, T147 |
| 7.20 | Approval no longer matches the recorded intent under the contract's current fingerprint rules | `AWAITING_REVIEW` with `APPROVAL_INTENT_MISMATCH` | Not until re-approved | T142 |
| 7.21 | Approver policy (e.g. no self-approval) | Up to `revalidate()`, which receives the approval and this call's `context` | Only when it says `proceed` | T143 |
| 7.22 | `runEffect()` called with 0.3's `reviewDecision: "approved"` / `"rejected"` | `TypeError` pointing to `reviewEffect()`; nothing recorded. `runEffect()` has no way to approve | No | T145 |
| 7.23 | An operation approved by 0.3.x, which recorded no decision (or any approval on record without a reviewer), after upgrading | `AWAITING_REVIEW` with `APPROVAL_NOT_RECORDED` before any further attempt | Not until re-approved | T149, T150, T159 |
| 7.24 | `reviewEffect()` records a decision | Records it and nothing else: no `execute()`, no `observe()`; the result says approved, not attempted since (also after earlier attempts); the next `runEffect()` attempts | Not by `reviewEffect()` | T151, T155 |
| 7.25 | `runEffect()` is handed a decision object (e.g. by an agent's tool) | `TypeError`, nothing recorded: decisions only go through `reviewEffect()` | No | T152 |
| 7.26 | `reviewEffect()` while another call holds the operation (or writes to it mid-review), or on one that isn't awaiting review | Busy: `OperationBusyError`, nothing recorded. Not awaiting review: `ReviewNotAcceptedError` (`NOT_AWAITING_REVIEW`) with the current state, nothing recorded | No | T153, T154, T156, T157 |
| 7.27 | Approved (separately) after an attempt that got a not-applied response | The next `runEffect()` re-observes that attempt first (also if the review record lacks its attempt count); an effect that appeared during the wait is `COMPLETE` | No | T155, T158 |
| 7.28 | A decision made on an earlier review's screen arrives after the operation went to review again | Refused (`ReviewNotAcceptedError`, `STALE_REVIEW_TOKEN`); a decision dated before the current review began is refused too (`DECIDED_BEFORE_REVIEW_OPENED`) | No | T160, T161 |
| 7.29 | Each review of an operation | New token and generation each time (including after an expired approval); a token from another operation is refused; operations that awaited review before tokens existed get one on their next `runEffect()`; survives a restart | — | T162, T163, T164, T165, T166 |
| 7.30 | The contract sets `maxApprovalAgeMs` | An approval stops covering attempts that much time after it was decided (or recorded, if earlier), with or without its own `expiresAt` (the earlier wins); already too old on arrival: refused; aged out before an attempt: `AWAITING_REVIEW` with `APPROVAL_EXPIRED` | Not until re-approved | T167, T168, T169, T170 |
| 7.31 | Upgrading from 0.4.0: an approval it recorded (no token), or an operation a 0.4.0 worker sent back to review without a new review | The approval isn't honored (`APPROVAL_NOT_RECORDED`, new review); the already-answered token is refused and the next `runEffect()` opens a new review | No | T171, T172, T173, T174 |
| 7.32 | Random sequences of all of the above: runs, decisions (current, stale, foreign, garbage tokens; dated before the review; expiring), `revalidate()` outcomes, transport outcomes, late landings, clock jumps, crashes, lock contention, 0.4.0 workers | At most one effect; nothing executes after close/rejection, without `revalidate()` saying proceed, or without an approval accepted since the last review and not yet expired; an approval after attempts re-observes first; exactly the decisions answering the open review are accepted | Only as above | T175, T176 |

## 8. Concurrency and lock loss

| # | Failure | corrobo records | `execute()` again? | Duplicate? | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | Two callers, same identity, same time | One executes; the other gets the recorded state | Once total | No | T51, T52 |
| 8.2 | Different identities concurrently | Run in parallel, no global lock | Independent | No | T53 |
| 8.3 | Loser arrives while an attempt is reserved | `ATTEMPT_IN_PROGRESS`, no disposition | No | No | T54 |
| 8.4 | Loser arrives before the record exists | `OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS`, no disposition | No | No | T55 |
| 8.5 | Race that ends `UNKNOWN` | Still one execution | No | No | T64 |
| 8.6 | Pool at or above `pool.max` concurrent identities | No self-deadlock; one connection per in-flight identity | — | No | T56 |
| 8.7 | Lock's DB session dies while `execute()` is still running | Another caller recovers without executing; the stale pass can't overwrite (version check) | Only per settlement rules (1.3–1.5) | No | T57, T58, T59 |
| 8.8 | A stale pass tries to reserve on top of another's attempt | Rejected by version check before `execute()` | No | No | T60 |
| 8.9 | Unlocking fails | Connection destroyed (its session lock ends); `release()` doesn't throw | — | No | T61 |
| 8.10 | Host clocks disagree | Window checks use the store's clock (Postgres: `clock_timestamp()`) | — | No | T62 |
| 8.11 | Database unavailable | Error surfaces before anything executes | No | No | T63 |

## 9. Identity and intent

| # | Failure | corrobo records | `execute()` again? | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9.1 | Same identity, different `operationType` | Throws; never executes | No | T65 |
| 9.2 | Same identity, different intent | Throws; never returns the other operation's result | No | T66, T67, T68 |
| 9.3 | Same intent, different key order | Same operation | No | T69 |
| 9.4 | Intent with irrelevant fields (nonces) | Use `fingerprintIntent()` to ignore them | No | T70 |
| 9.5 | Intent containing a `Date` | Stored as ISO string; matches itself after a Postgres round trip; a different date is a conflict | No | T71 |
| 9.6 | Intent JSON can't store faithfully: circular, function, symbol, BigInt, Map, Set, typed array, getter, or `undefined` itself | `TypeError` naming the path, before anything is written or executed | No | T72, T73, T74, T105, T106, T107 |
| 9.8 | Intents that JSON stores identically: `{ a: undefined }` / `{}`, `NaN` / `null`, a `Date` / its ISO string | The same operation — identity follows what is stored | No | T108, T109, T110 |
| 9.10 | Intent reads differently each time (a stateful `toJSON()`) | Read exactly once per call; that reading is what's stored and fingerprinted; a later, different reading is a loud conflict | No | T113 |
| 9.11 | Request's explicit `identity.operationType` differs from the contract's (or pass the id as a plain string) | Throws before anything is written or executed; a string id always uses the contract's `operationType` | No | T114, T115 |
| 9.9 | Contract supplies its own `fingerprintIntent()` | corrobo uses it and does not apply the default JSON rules to that intent; the store must still be able to persist the intent | No | T70, T111 |
| 9.7 | A new identity | A genuinely new operation | Yes (it's new) | T75 |
| 9.12 | Custom `fingerprintIntent()` that ignores a field `execute()` reads; a later request differs in it | Same operation; corrobo acts on the recorded (reviewed) intent, never the later request's | Only as recorded | T180 |
| 9.13 | Custom `fingerprintIntent()`; the intent's `toJSON()` differs from the object, and a reviewer passes `fingerprintIntent(contract, intent)` of that object | The exported `fingerprintIntent()` uses the JSON form, as `runEffect()` does, so the approval matches | Once approved | T190 |

## 10. Persistence and privacy

| # | Situation | Behavior | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10.1 | `execute()`/`observe()` throws an error carrying secrets or PII in `error.raw` | `PostgresStore` never persists `error.raw` (transport and observation) | T76, T77 |
| 10.2 | Your own data has a field named `raw` | Not stripped | T78 |
| 10.3 | Thrown value is Error-like (`{ message, headers }`) | The recorded message is its own string `message` and nothing else of it; the thrown object itself stays in memory only (`error.raw`), never persisted by `PostgresStore` (10.1) | T79 |
| 10.4 | Thrown value isn't an Error (string, `undefined`, `null`, number, object with functions), or even its message can't be read | Recorded as a transport failure; the pass never crashes | T87, T88, T112 |
| 10.5 | `PostgresStore` constructed without `{ acknowledgePersistence: true }` | Throws | T80, T81, T82 |
| 10.6 | `InMemoryStore` | No acknowledgement, no persistence beyond the process | T83, T101 |
| 10.7 | Nested evidence, observations, reason metadata | Round-trip through Postgres exactly | T84, T85 |
| 10.8 | Retention | No automatic expiry or deletion; retention is yours | T86 |
| 10.9 | Upgrading from 0.2.x | `migrate()` adds `version` in place; old reserved rows recover; old transport-failure `RETRY`s are re-checked under current rules | T89, T90, T91 |
| 10.10 | Upgrading from 0.3.x | `migrate()` adds `blocked_by` and `review` in place; existing rows keep their state and version, and a 0.3.x rejection still reads as rejected | T129, T146 |

Error **messages** are still persisted: if your code puts secrets into an error message, intent, observation or reason metadata, they are stored as you wrote them.

## 11. Provider idempotency and correlation

| # | Situation | Behavior | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11.1 | Provider idempotency key | Same key on every attempt of one operation; a new operation never reuses it | T92, T93 |
| 11.2 | A lost response, or a re-check long after the attempt (past the key's retention, e.g. Stripe's ~24h) | The read-back finds the refund by the operation id the request carried in its metadata, so it never relies on the key's retention; the request is only re-sent by a retry, with the same key | T94, T184 |
| 11.3 | Stable provider id known from `execute()` | Later checks look it up directly | T95 |
| 11.4 | Lookup only by search/listing | **Assumes:** your contract returns `UNKNOWN` when absence can't be proven — see 3.4 | T30 |
| 11.5 | An `observe()` that could create the effect (e.g. replaying the create request as its "read-back") | Not allowed: `observe()` runs where nothing may execute (crash recovery, re-checks, after an approval expired), so it must only read. The Stripe example reads only; an expired approval leads to review, not a refund | T181 |
| 11.6 | Stripe example: an unlabeled refund of the same amount on the charge (made before refunds were labeled, or by hand) | Absence can't be proven: `UNKNOWN` (`UNLABELED_REFUND_PRESENT`), never a second refund | T187 |

## 12. What corrobo itself does on your machine

| # | Guarantee | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| 12.1 | No logging of any kind in the library source | T96 |
| 12.2 | No network code except `PostgresStore` talking to the pool you pass in | T97, T98 |
| 12.3 | No install-time scripts and no runtime dependencies (`pg` is an optional peer, used only through the pool you pass in) | T99 |

## Not covered by this matrix

- Writes to the external system made outside corrobo.
- A `maxInFlightMs` smaller than the provider's real processing time.
- A custom `EffectStore` without version-checked writes or same-identity locking.
- Exactly-once delivery in general: corrobo guarantees it will not *itself* cause a blind duplicate, within the rows above.
